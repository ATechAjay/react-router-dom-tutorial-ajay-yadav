# Routing

Routing is an essential technique for navigation among pages on a website based on user requests and actions.

# React Router

A separate library named **React Router** enables routing in React applications and allows defining multiple routes in an application.

# Why React Router

React is a famous JavaScript framework ideal for building _single-page applications_. React does not include many advanced features or routing by default.

Therefore, React Router is an excellent choice of navigation for these single-page applications to render multiple views or pages.

React Router is a popular standard library for routing among various view components in React applications. It helps keep the user interface in sync with the URL.

The three main packages related to React Router are:

1. **react-router** : Contains the core functionality of React Router, including route-matching algorithms and hooks.

2. **react-router-dom** : Includes everything in react-router and adds a few DOM-specific APIs.

3. **react-router-native** : Includes everything in react-router and adds a few React Native-specific APIs.

# What Is React Router DOM?

The primary functionality of react-router-dom is implementing dynamic routing in web applications.

Based on the platform and the requirements of the application, react-router-dom supports component-based routing, which is the ideal solution for routing if the React application is running on the browser.

# Client-Side Routing VS Server-Side Routing

When JavaScript is used on a web page, it is executed in web browsers. In this case, JavaScript works as a Client-side language.

However, Server-side JavaScript executes on the server that allows us to access databases, file systems, etc.
